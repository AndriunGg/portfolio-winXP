# 🖥 Windows XP Portfolio — Retro Dev Showcase  
A retro-styled portfolio concept that mimics the classic Windows XP desktop, designed for developers who want to present their work with creativity and nostalgia — **not an emulator**, just pure aesthetic.

## ✨ Features

### 🖥 Authentic XP Visuals  
Faithfully recreated UI elements such as taskbar, icons, windows, and boot-style visuals — only for presentation.

### 📁 Projects as “Programs”  
Present your repositories or demos as clickable desktop icons, Start Menu entries, or XP windows.

### 🎨 Retro Design, Modern Purpose  
An ideal portfolio format for resumes, landing pages, themed showcases, game dev presentations, or browser-based demos.

## 🗺️ Purpose  
This project is a **visual concept**, not a functional emulator.  
Its goal is to mix **nostalgia** + **personality** to help developers stand out from generic portfolio layouts.
