🖥️ Windows XP Portfolio — Retro Dev Showcase

Windows XP Portfolio is a nostalgic, XP-themed interface designed as a creative way for developers to present their projects. Instead of functioning as a real emulator, it delivers a stylized portfolio experience that mimics the classic Windows XP environment.

This concept is perfect for developers who want to showcase their work with personality, charm, and retro flair — without any OS installation or virtualization.

✨ Highlights

🖥️ Authentic XP-Style UI
A faithful recreation of the classic Windows XP desktop aesthetic, used purely for presentation.

📁 Project Showcases as "Programs"
Each project can appear as a desktop icon, window, or start menu entry — just like the old days.

🎨 Nostalgic Design for Modern Portfolios
Ideal for resumes, personal sites, demos, or themed developer profiles.

Created as a visual experience — not a functional emulator — this portfolio concept blends creativity and nostalgia to stand out in a world of generic layouts.
